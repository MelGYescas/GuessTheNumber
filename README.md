# Guess The Number

## Overview

"Guess The Number" is an interactive mobile game developed with Flutter, designed to challenge users with the classic number guessing game. The app elevates the traditional experience by introducing multiple difficulty levels and a sophisticated state management system to ensure a dynamic user experience.

Players are prompted to guess a secret number within a specific range, with the number of attempts and difficulty adjusting based on the level selected by the user. It features a user-friendly interface and provides immediate feedback on the guesses made, guiding players towards the correct answer through an intuitive "higher than" or "lower than" hint system.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels ranging from Easy to Extreme, with a varying range of numbers and attempts.
- Intuitive input validation to ensure that only valid numbers within the allowed range are accepted.
- Real-time state management displaying the number of attempts left and dynamically updating hint columns.
- History tracking that visualizes past guesses with color-coded responses, indicating successful and unsuccessful attempts.
- A UI that closely follows the provided design specifications.
